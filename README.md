# WORKOUT PLANNER

## Project Description

This application is a **workout planner**. It will let you plan workouts throughout a week and check them off as you 
complete them. It will also keep track of your previous workouts, so you can see your progress.

This application is for people who want to keep track of their workouts and/or want to plan their workouts. If working
out is not a habit for you, making a plan can help *motivate you to work out*.

I chose this as my project because I'm not satisfied with my physical condition. I have tried working out in the
past, but I never stuck to it for longer than a couple weeks. I'm making this application to help me *exercise
regularly* and get in *better shape*.
